       <div class="cont1">
        <p class="par">One of Barcelona's most iconic landmarks is the Sagrada Família, a basilica designed by the legendary architect Antoni Gaudí. This UNESCO World Heritage Site has been under construction since 1882, with intricate facades depicting the life of Christ, and a towering, surrealist interior that combines Gothic and Art Nouveau styles. Another significant site is the Gothic Quarter, where visitors can find the Barcelona Cathedral, or La Seu, an impressive 13th-century Gothic church that stands as a testament to the city's medieval history. The narrow streets of this quarter are filled with ancient Roman walls, charming plazas, and traditional tapas bars.</p>

        <h3 class="H">History</h3>
        <div class="cont1">
        <p class="par">Barcelona has a deep-rooted history that dates back over 2,000 years to its founding as a Roman colony. Throughout the Middle Ages, it flourished as a center for trade and commerce, becoming a prominent medieval city. In the 19th century, the Catalan Renaissance brought renewed interest in Catalan language, arts, and culture, leading to the construction of many modernist buildings that define Barcelona today. This history of independence and artistic innovation makes Barcelona a cultural hub with a unique identity distinct from the rest of Spain.</p>
